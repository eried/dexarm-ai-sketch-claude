# Alternative Plotter SVG Methods - Explained

## üéØ Problem Being Solved

The current SVG generation creates **outlines** of thick strokes (two lines around the edge of a thick contour). This is not ideal for pen plotting because:

1. It creates **double lines** where there should be a single stroke
2. Lines are not **continuous** - lots of pen-ups and pen-downs
3. Doesn't capture the **artistic flow** of thick brush strokes
4. Not optimized for **minimal travel distance**

## üìä Three Alternative Methods

After each photo is processed, the system now generates **4 SVG files**:

1. **Original** (Version 8) - `drawing_TIMESTAMP.svg`
2. **Method 1** - `drawing_TIMESTAMP_method1_centerline.svg`
3. **Method 2** - `drawing_TIMESTAMP_method2_thick_joining.svg`
4. **Method 3** - `drawing_TIMESTAMP_method3_cnc_style.svg`

## Method 1: Centerline Tracing (Plotter-Recommended) üé®

**Filename:** `*_method1_centerline.svg`

### What It Does:
- Uses **morphological skeletonization** to find the centerline of thick strokes
- Creates **single lines** down the middle of thick contours
- Optimizes path order using **greedy nearest-neighbor** algorithm
- Minimizes pen-up travel distance

### Technical Approach:
1. Edge detection (Canny 30-100)
2. Dilate edges to create thick strokes (3x3 kernel, 2 iterations)
3. **Skeletonize** to find centerlines (industry standard for plotters)
4. Simplify paths using Douglas-Peucker (epsilon=0.5)
5. Optimize drawing order (nearest-neighbor TSP approximation)

### Best For:
- **Clean, continuous lines**
- **Professional plotter output**
- **Minimal pen-ups**
- Similar to how actual artists draw (single stroke)

### Parameters:
- Edge threshold: 30-100 (captures all details)
- Dilation: 2 iterations (simulate pen width)
- Simplification: 0.5 epsilon (preserves detail)
- Stroke width: 1.0px

## Method 2: Thick Line Detection with Joining üîó

**Filename:** `*_method2_thick_joining.svg`

### What It Does:
- Detects thick contours and finds their centerlines
- **Intelligently joins** nearby line segments into long continuous paths
- **Smooths** the joined paths using Gaussian filtering
- Creates artist-like flowing strokes

### Technical Approach:
1. Bilateral filter (preserves edges while reducing noise)
2. Edge detection (Canny 50-150)
3. Extract contours and find centerlines
4. **Join segments within 15 pixels** of each other
5. **Smooth** joined paths with Gaussian filter (sigma=1.5)
6. Optimize drawing order

### Best For:
- **Long, continuous strokes**
- **Natural-looking lines**
- **Artist-like flow**
- Captures the gesture of thick brush strokes

### Parameters:
- Join threshold: 15 pixels (connects nearby segments)
- Smoothing: Gaussian sigma=1.5 (gentle smoothing)
- Simplification: 1.0 epsilon
- Stroke width: 1.2px (slightly thicker)

### Key Feature:
**Intelligent joining algorithm** that:
- Finds nearby segment endpoints
- Reverses segments if needed for continuity
- Creates smooth transitions
- Extends paths iteratively

## Method 3: CNC V-Carving Style (Layered) üèîÔ∏è

**Filename:** `*_method3_cnc_style.svg`

### What It Does:
- Uses **multi-threshold** edge detection to create depth layers
- Draws multiple passes with **variable stroke widths**
- Simulates V-carving toolpaths (adapted for drawing)
- Creates rich, layered appearance

### Technical Approach:
1. Three edge detection layers:
   - **Light edges** (20-60): Outer contours ‚Üí 2.0px stroke
   - **Medium edges** (40-120): Mid contours ‚Üí 1.2px stroke
   - **Dark edges** (80-200): Inner details ‚Üí 0.8px stroke
2. Draw from **outside-in** (larger to smaller)
3. Variable stroke widths create depth illusion

### Best For:
- **Rich, detailed drawings**
- **Variable line weights**
- **Depth and dimension**
- Multiple passes for shading effect

### Parameters:
- 3 threshold layers
- Stroke widths: 2.0, 1.2, 0.8px
- Drawing order: Outside ‚Üí Inside
- Simplification: 0.8 epsilon

### Key Feature:
**Layered approach** similar to CNC V-carving where:
- Light passes create wide strokes
- Dark passes add fine details
- Multiple passes build up form

## üöÄ How to Use

### Automatic Generation:
After each photo is processed, all 4 SVG files are automatically created in the `svgs/` folder.

### File Naming:
```
drawing_20251019_123456.svg                      ‚Üê Original (Version 8)
drawing_20251019_123456_method1_centerline.svg   ‚Üê Method 1
drawing_20251019_123456_method2_thick_joining.svg ‚Üê Method 2
drawing_20251019_123456_method3_cnc_style.svg    ‚Üê Method 3
```

### Evaluation:
1. Take a photo
2. Check the `svgs/` folder
3. Open all 4 files in a browser or SVG viewer
4. Compare the different approaches
5. Choose which method works best for your use case

### Current Drawing Process:
- **Still uses the original Version 8** for robot drawing
- Alternative methods are **generated for evaluation only**
- Once you choose a preferred method, we can switch it

## üîß Technical Details

### Skeletonization (Method 1):
Uses scikit-image's morphological skeleton algorithm:
- Iteratively thins edges until 1-pixel wide
- Preserves topology (connectivity)
- Finds medial axis of thick strokes

### Joining Algorithm (Method 2):
```python
1. For each segment:
   a. Find nearest unjoined segment endpoint
   b. If within threshold (15px):
      - Extend current path
      - Reverse segment if needed for continuity
   c. Repeat until no nearby segments found
2. Smooth final path with Gaussian filter
```

### Path Optimization (Methods 1 & 2):
Greedy nearest-neighbor TSP:
```python
1. Start with first path
2. Find nearest path endpoint (try both start and end)
3. Reverse if needed for minimal travel
4. Repeat until all paths ordered
```
