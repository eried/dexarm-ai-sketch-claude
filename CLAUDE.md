# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository appears to be a new project for an AI-powered sketch booth application. The codebase is currently empty and awaiting initialization.

## Getting Started

Since this is a new project, you'll likely need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on user requirements
2. Set up a build system (e.g., Vite, webpack, or similar)
3. Configure TypeScript/JavaScript as appropriate
4. Set up any necessary frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)

## Development Commands

Commands will be added as the project structure is established. Typical commands might include:

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint code
```

## Architecture

The architecture will be documented as the project develops. For an AI sketch booth application, consider documenting:

- How the AI integration works (API endpoints, model used)
- Image processing pipeline
- User session management
- Canvas/drawing interface implementation
- Export/save functionality

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project structure and architecture are established.
