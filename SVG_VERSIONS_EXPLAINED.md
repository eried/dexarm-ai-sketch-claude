# SVG Generation Methods - Version Comparison (Updated)

When you generate a caricature, the system creates **10 different SVG versions** with various artistic styles including shading, hatching, and scribbling techniques.

All versions are saved as `drawing_[timestamp]_version[0-9].svg`

---

## üìã New Version Overview

### **Version 0: Horizontal Hatching**
- **Method:** Canny edges + horizontal hatching in dark areas
- **Style:** Classic pen & ink with horizontal shading lines
- **Best for:** Traditional sketch look with simple shading
- **Characteristics:** Clean outlines with horizontal lines filling shadows

---

### **Version 1: Sobel (Your Favorite!)** ‚≠ê
- **Method:** Sobel edge detection - clean geometric edges
- **Style:** Strong directional edges, no shading
- **Best for:** General purpose, clean line art
- **Characteristics:** Sharp, precise edges with good detail
- **Note:** This was your favorite from the previous Version 7

---

### **Version 2: Cross-Hatching**
- **Method:** Canny edges + cross-hatching in shadows
- **Style:** Traditional pen & ink with crossed lines for shading
- **Best for:** Classic drawing aesthetic, realistic shading
- **Characteristics:** Perpendicular lines create depth and shadow

---

### **Version 3: Diagonal Scribbles**
- **Method:** Canny edges + diagonal scribble marks in dark areas
- **Style:** Loose, sketchy with angled hatching
- **Best for:** Artistic, hand-drawn feel
- **Characteristics:** 45¬∞ angled marks give motion and energy

---

### **Version 4: Stippling (Dots)**
- **Method:** Edges + random dot patterns in shadows
- **Style:** Pointillism-inspired shading technique
- **Best for:** Soft, textured shadows
- **Characteristics:** Dots create gradual tonal transitions

---

### **Version 5: Circular Scribbles**
- **Method:** Edges + small circles in dark areas
- **Style:** Artistic circular shading marks
- **Best for:** Unique artistic style, organic feel
- **Characteristics:** Circular patterns create interesting texture

---

### **Version 6: Wavy Lines**
- **Method:** Edges + wavy horizontal lines in shadows
- **Style:** Flowing, organic hatching
- **Best for:** Softer, less rigid shading
- **Characteristics:** Sinusoidal waves create dynamic shading

---

### **Version 7: Random Scribbles**
- **Method:** Laplacian edges + random-angle scribbles
- **Style:** Very loose, artistic sketch
- **Best for:** Abstract, energetic drawings
- **Characteristics:** Random angle marks create chaotic energy

---

### **Version 8: Contour-Following Hatching** ‚≠ê (CURRENT DEFAULT)
- **Method:** Edges + hatching that follows contour curves
- **Style:** Professional illustrative shading with longer strokes
- **Best for:** Realistic form representation, 3D appearance
- **Characteristics:** Long lines (3x length) follow object contours, shows dimensionality
- **Note:** Lines are 3x longer than other versions for better shading effect

---

### **Version 9: Dense Diagonal Hatching**
- **Method:** Thick edges + dense diagonal hatching
- **Style:** Heavy shading with close-spaced diagonal lines
- **Best for:** Dark, dramatic drawings with strong shadows
- **Characteristics:** High contrast, bold appearance

---

## üéØ Quick Selection Guide

## üñäÔ∏è Shading Techniques Explained

### **Hatching**
Parallel lines in one direction. Spacing and angle create different effects:
- Horizontal = calm, stable
- Diagonal = dynamic, energetic
- Density = shadow depth

### **Cross-Hatching**
Overlapping perpendicular lines create darker tones and richer shadows.

### **Stippling**
Dots create tone through density - more dots = darker areas.

### **Scribbling**
Short random marks create texture and energy - common in gesture drawings.

### **Contour Hatching**
Lines follow the form's curves - creates 3D illusion and shows volume.

## üîç Technical Details

**Dark Area Detection:** Pixels with value < 100 (on 0-255 scale) are considered "dark" and receive shading.

**Line Weight:**
- Outlines: 1.0px
- Shading marks: 0.5px

**Spacing Parameters:**
- Hatching: 6-10 pixels between lines
- Scribbles: 15-20 pixels between marks
- Stippling: 3 pixels with 30% density

## üìù How to Use

1. **Take a photo** - All 10 versions generate automatically
2. **Check `svgs/` folder** - Look for `_version0.svg` through `_version9.svg`
3. **Open them in a browser** to compare
4. **Choose your favorite** or use different versions for different photos!

**Current default:** Version 8 (Contour-Following Hatching with 3x longer lines)

The app will automatically use Version 8 for drawing, but all 10 versions are available in the svgs/ folder.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Changing the Default

The app currently uses **Version 8** as the default (Contour-following hatching with long strokes).

If you want a different style as the default, let me know which version number and I'll update the code!
